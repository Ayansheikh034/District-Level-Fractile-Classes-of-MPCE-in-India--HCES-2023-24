# District-Level Fractile Classes of MPCE in India (HCES 2023–24)

This repository contains the supplementary dataset for the study:“Disparities in Household Consumption in India: A District-Level Diagnosis of MPCE Inequality and Statistical Robustness”.

The dataset provides District-wise fractile class distributions of Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) For all States and Union Territories of India Disaggregated by Rural and Urban sectors

## This repository ensures open access, transparency, and supports reproducibility for policy-relevant research.

# Study Objectives

Measure inequality in household consumption expenditure at the district level.

Classify households into fractile classes (deciles, quintiles, or custom percentiles).

Assess statistical robustness of estimates using:

Finite Population Correction (FPC)

Design Effect (DEFF)

Identify districts with sufficient sample sizes for reliable inference.
